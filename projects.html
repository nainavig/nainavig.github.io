  <h2>Tiny Search Engine</h2>
  <p>Implemented in C a web search tool. Included crawler, indexer, and querier modules.
    Given an initial webpage and a depth, the crawler
    stores each webpage linked to the initial webpage to a directory until maximum depth is reached.
    Given a directory containing html files, the indexer outputs an index file containing the word counts
    for each word that occurs in any of the files.
    The querier is passed a directory given by the crawler and an index file given by the indexer.
    It takes user inputs of search phrases and then outputs a sorted list of relevant webpages by word count.</p>
